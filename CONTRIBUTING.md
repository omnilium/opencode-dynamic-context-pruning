## Getting Started

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a feature branch.
3.  Implement your changes and add tests if applicable (please NO AI SLOP).
4.  Ensure all tests pass and the code is formatted.
5.  Submit a Pull Request.

## Development Setup

Use Node.js and pnpm. From your checkout:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

This installs the bundled test logger's dependencies through the [tests/logger](tests/logger/) pnpm workspace; pnpm
treats the differing OpenTUI peer versions used by OpenCode V1 and V2 as warnings rather than hard errors.

Run the checks relevant to your changes before submitting a pull request:

```sh
pnpm test                  # DCP and request-logger tests
pnpm run typecheck         # TypeScript validation
pnpm run check:package     # Build and validate the npm package
pnpm run format:check      # Formatting
```

## Compatibility

DCP provides server and terminal integrations for OpenCode V1 and V2, using shared package entrypoints and `dcp.jsonc`
settings. Exercise both hosts when changing shared behavior.

Use [package.json](package.json) for dependency requirements and [the lab Dockerfile](tests/lab/Dockerfile) for pinned
integration-test versions. Host-specific behavior is implemented in [index.ts](index.ts), [tui.tsx](tui.tsx), and
[lib/v2/](lib/v2/).

V2 uses `@4@` message IDs and `@b1@` summary IDs. Compression inputs include the whole marker; range summaries use
`@b1@` placeholders for nested summaries. Message-mode priority labels look like `@4@ [high]`; `@blocked@` marks content
that cannot be selected. V1 uses XML ID tags. Custom prompt overrides must describe the ID format of the host they run
on.

## Local Installation

After building, add this checkout's absolute path to your OpenCode configuration.

For **V2**, use `opencode.json`:

```jsonc
{
    "plugins": [{ "package": "/absolute/path/to/opencode-dynamic-context-pruning" }],
    "permissions": [{ "action": "compress", "resource": "*", "effect": "allow" }],
}
```

For **V1**, add the following to both `opencode.json` (server plugin) and the separate `tui.json` (panel):

```jsonc
{ "plugin": ["/absolute/path/to/opencode-dynamic-context-pruning"] }
```

## Manual Sandbox

The sandbox requires Docker, Node/pnpm, and saved OpenCode authentication. The request logger is included in
[tests/logger](tests/logger/); only the DCP checkout is needed. Complete [Development Setup](#development-setup), then
run:

```sh
pnpm run sandbox                 # OpenCode V2
pnpm run sandbox -- --v1         # OpenCode V1
```

Each launch uses the latest stable OpenCode release for the selected major version, rebuilds local DCP and the test
logger, and prepares a clean Docker image. Run `pnpm run sandbox -- --help` for available options and defaults. Each
launch copies all saved authentication from the matching host version: V1's `auth.json`, or V2's credential records and
account selections. OpenCode handles provider authentication normally inside the container; copied credentials can be
refreshed there without writing back to the host.

V1's auth file is under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode` (normally `~/.local/share/opencode`). V2's database is located with
`opencode2 debug paths db`, or the standard data directory when that command is unavailable. Set `DCP_AUTH_PATH` to
select a different V1 auth file or V2 database. Credentials embedded in host configuration or environment variables are
not copied. Custom provider definitions can be added to `opencode.json` in the sandbox's scratch workspace.

The sandbox has its own sessions, scratch workspace, and configuration under `~/.local/state/dcp-sandbox/`. V1 uses the
`v1/` subdirectory, with a separate database. Your host project and normal OpenCode configuration are not mounted. Try
`/dcp` for the panel or `/dcp-compress` for a compression pass.

```sh
pnpm run sandbox -- --fresh                 # New profile; keep old runs
pnpm run sandbox -- --logs                  # Latest log paths and capture counts
pnpm run sandbox -- --path                  # Current profile's host directory
pnpm run sandbox -- -- --continue           # Resume a session
pnpm run sandbox -- --opencode VERSION      # Use an exact release for this launch
pnpm run sandbox -- --dcp latest --fresh    # Test the published npm DCP in a new profile
ppnpm run sandbox -- --dcp 1.0.0             # Test a specific npm DCP release
pnpm run sandbox -- --transport http        # Select V2's transport
pnpm run sandbox -- --model PROVIDER/MODEL   # Select a model available to your account
```

Replace `VERSION`, `PROVIDER`, and `MODEL` with the release and model you want to test. Without a saved model choice,
OpenCode selects its default. A V2 transport override applies to the selected model. Add `--v1` to manage the V1
sandbox. Model and transport choices persist. An exact version override applies only to that launch; otherwise the
latest stable release is selected. `--fresh` selects a new profile for subsequent launches. `--dcp VERSION` uses
`@omnilium/opencode-dcp@VERSION` through OpenCode's npm plugin loader instead of building local DCP. It accepts npm
versions, tags, and ranges on both V1 and V2. The test logger is still built locally. The DCP choice applies only to
that launch; omit it or use `--dcp local` to return to the checkout. You can edit `dcp.jsonc` and CLI preferences;
`opencode.json` is launcher-managed. Set `DCP_SANDBOX_DIR` to choose another state directory.

For a shortcut on Linux, run from the checkout:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s "$PWD/scripts/sandbox.mjs" ~/.local/bin/dcp-sandbox
dcp-sandbox
```

### Request Logs

The logger is development-only tooling and is excluded from DCP's published npm package. Each launch has `raw/` and
`readable/` directories under its timestamped log folder. The launcher manages the WebSocket relay and readable-log
watcher. Requests appear as they are sent; assembled responses appear when they finish, while the session stays open.
`--logs` only shows paths and capture counts.

Start at `readable/index.json`, then a session's numbered request folders:

```text
readable/<session>/0001_primary_websocket/
  request.json       # Pretty-printed body actually sent
  response.json      # Assistant content, parsed tool calls, token totals, errors
  meta.json          # Timing, completion, transport, raw source, continuation ID
```

V2's full pre-transport snapshots are in each session's `context/` directory. WebSocket continuation requests remain
deltas with `previous_response_id`. Partial and failed responses are marked in metadata. Full provider metadata,
original HTTP bytes, and WebSocket frames remain available in `raw/`.

## Integration Tests

The containerized lab exercises packed plugins on V1 and V2, including saved-auth copying, HTTP and WebSocket
compression, commands, permissions, concurrent sessions, persistence, and native compaction. It uses a local mock
provider without live credentials.

After [Development Setup](#development-setup), build [tests/lab/Dockerfile](tests/lab/Dockerfile) using the image tag
expected by [scripts/lab.mjs](scripts/lab.mjs), then run:

```sh
node scripts/lab.mjs
```

The runner prints its output directory under `/tmp/opencode/dcp-lab/`. Set `DCP_LAB_DIR` to override it. Add `--built`
to reuse an existing DCP build. For real-provider checks, `node scripts/lab.mjs --live` uses the current build and saved
V2 authentication. Its OpenAI Responses scenarios require access to the model configured in
[tests/lab/live.mjs](tests/lab/live.mjs).

Inspect capture summaries without opening large transcripts:

```sh
node tests/lab/inspect.mjs <log-directory>
```

Terminal-panel checks require `uv` and reuse a completed lab run:

```sh
uv run --with pexpect --with pyte tests/lab/ui.py <lab-output-directory> v2
uv run --with pexpect --with pyte tests/lab/ui.py <lab-output-directory> v1
```

These check the panel, Context, Stats, persisted manual-mode toggle, and closing the dialog. They also check mouse-wheel
scrolling and resizing down to 20 rows, with back/close buttons remaining visible. Terminal transcripts and screen
snapshots are saved in the lab output.

To check another V2 release, build the lab image with `--build-arg V2=VERSION` and pass that image's tag as the final
argument to `ui.py`. Use a separate copy of the lab output when testing different releases so their databases stay
independent.
